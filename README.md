# FiniteSquareWell_Animations
Animations for Finite Square Well potential solutions to the Schr√∂dinger Equation. Superposition of the ground and first excited Eigen Energy States evolving with time.

Here is the animation for the even case:

As you can there is a superposition between probability distributions of the ground and first excited states of this solution.


Here is the two energy state distributions from the even solution graphed separately for context:
