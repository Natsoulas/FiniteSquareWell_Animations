As you can see I am a clown. I have an issue that my probability distribution for the combined wavefunction of the ground and first excited eigenstates is not normalized... All I can say is the individual psi0 and psi1 are normalized as I verified with integrating from - to + infinity however when I combine them they are not despite the absolute value square of their coefficients also adding up to 1... Idk. I have until sunday to fix this.
