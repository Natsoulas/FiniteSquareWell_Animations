# FiniteSquareWell_Animations
Animations for Finite Square Well potential solutions to the Schr√∂dinger Equation. Superposition of the ground and first excited Eigen Energy States evolving with time.

This is the provide potential where a is 1 and V0 is 25. all other constants are assumed to be 1.

Here is the animation, it is run from t = 0:10 seconds, however it repeats since it is a gif:

As you can there is a superposition between probability distributions of the ground energy state (even) and the first excited energy state (odd) in this animation. There is also an mp4 in the animations folder of this repository.



Here is the two energy state distributions graphed separately for context:

Here are their respective wavefunctions to more clearly see that they are the ground and first excited states with one being even and the other odd:

Feel free to use or ask me about this software. This was a project for my Quantum Mechanics Class.
