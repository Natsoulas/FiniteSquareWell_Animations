# FiniteSquareWell_Animations
Animations for Finite Square Well potential solutions to the Schrödinger Equation. Superposition of the ground and first excited Eigen Energy States evolving with time.

This is the provide potential where a is 1 and V0 is 25. all other constants are assumed to be 1.

Here is the animation for the even case:

As you can there is a superposition between probability distributions of the ground and first excited states of this solution.


Here is the two energy state distributions from the even solution graphed separately for context:
